## Project Overview
Two of the big subjects are discussed in the assignment. The first one deals with selection algorithms to locate the k th smallest element in an array. Deterministic and randomized implementations are done. Median of Medians is a deterministic algorithm, which has worst-case linear time complexity O(n). Quickselect algorithm, which is completely random, has the expected time of O(n), and worst-case time of O(n 2) in worst-case situations. The second issue is implementation and discussion of elementary data structures, such as arrays, matrices, stacks, queues and singly linked lists. The analysis of each data structure in terms of time complexity, trade-offs and applications are provided.

## Folder Structure
The project contains individual scripts of selection algorithms, empirical analysis and data structure realisation. Deterministic median of mediocre selection algorithm is in deterministic selection.py and Quickselect algorithm is in randomized selection.py. The empirical_analysis.py script is a comparison between the time of deterministic and randomized selection on arrays of various sizes. The data_structures.py script illustrates the arrays, matrices, stack, queue and linked list. The application of this organization enables the operation of each component separately keeping the results clear.

## Instructions to Run Code
In order to execute the deterministic selection algorithm, start the Python deterministic selection.py in the terminal. It is a script that finds the k th smallest element by Median of Medians and returns the median to a sample array. In order to execute the randomized Quickselect algorithm, run python randomized selection.py. In this script, a random pivot is chosen and the k th smallest element is calculated and the median of a sample array is shown. To make empirical comparisons between the performance of both selection algorithms, run python empirical analysis.py. In this script, runtime is assessed using arrays of 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 50,000 elements and median values and time spent are recorded. In order to illustrate the elementary data structures, run python data structures.py. This program will execute every operation of call-insertion, deletion, access, and traversal of an array, matrices, stacks, queues, and singly linked lists with the output to each structure being given.

## Summary of Findings
Median of Medians algorithm is the algorithm that always identifies k th smallest element in linear time, independent of the input distribution, whether it contains duplicates, sorted or reverse-sorted arrays. The randomized Quickselect has better average running time on random arrays though it does experience minor variability in the runtime because of pivot selection. Theory meets with empirical results worse is deterministic selection which has predictable performance and randomized selection which has expected linear time.
Arrays are useful due to their O(1) time complexity of the random accesses, but their time complexity of insertion and removal in the middle of the array is linear O(n). Linked lists allow efficient insertion and deletion in O 1 time and random access in O (n) time. Stack operations have a LIFO behavior with a constant time of insertion and deletion. Operation of queues is FIFO; linked list implementation has much better dequeue performance when compared to array-based queue. Scientific computing, image processing and storing tabular data use arrays and matrices. Stacks find application in expression evaluation, undo/redo feature and back tracking algorithms. Queues aid in scheduling, process management, breadth-first search and real-time task management. Linked lists: Linked lists are useful in managing dynamic memory, as adjacency lists in graphs, and in performing common insertions and deletions (i.e. dynamic buffers or data streams).

## Software Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher is required. The scripts do not require external libraries other than the numpy, required in the course of empirical analysis (pip install numpy).
